        <ol>
            <li>Place the <b>chicken thighs and drumsticks</b> in a medium-sized bowl
                 and pour the <b>wine</b>, <b>chicken stock</b>, and (if using) the <b>brandy</b> over 
                 the top. Prep the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Add the <b>lardon</b> to a large, high-sided pan or braiser over 
                medium-high heat. Cook until the lardon is crispy, about 8 
                minutes, then remove it from the pan with a slotted spoon.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the wine marinade
                and dry the chicken well with paper towels. Season the chicken 
                with ½ teaspoon of <b>salt and pepper.</b></li>
            <li>Working in 2 batches if needed, place the chicken in the pan, 
                skin side down. Sear until golden on both sides (about 8-10 minutes 
                total), then remove the chicken. Remove all but two tablespoons 
                of the lardon/chicken oil from the pan – reserving the oil to use 
                later in the recipe.</li>
            <li>Add the <b>sliced onion and carrots</b> to the pan and let them cook until 
                the onion is golden brown, about 7-8 minutes. Add the <b>garlic</b> to the 
                pan and let it cook for 1 minute.
</li>
            <li>Push the vegetables to the side of the pan and add the <b>tomato paste.</b> 
                Cook the tomato paste until it is fragrant and begins to darken. 
                Pour in the reserved wine marinade, add the remaining ½ teaspoon 
                of salt and pepper, and bring it to a boil for 5 minutes, scraping
                 the bottom to remove any stuck-on bits.</li>
            <li>Nestle the chicken into the pan and sprinkle the thyme over top. 
                Cover the pan, turn the heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 tablespoon of the reserved oil (or use olive oil) into a
                 large skillet. Add the <b>mushrooms</b> and saute over medium-high heat 
                 until brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the pearl onions to the pan with the chicken and cook for 10 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix your choice of <b>beurre manie.</b> 
                Remove the chicken from the pan,
                 add the beurre manie, and stir until the sauce thickens. 
                  Season to taste with salt and pepper </li>
            <li>Add the chicken back into the pan and top with the cooked bacon 
                and mushrooms. Sprinkle with a <b>fresh thyme.</b></li>
            
        </ol>
